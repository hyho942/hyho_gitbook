# Function

## Function is...

A function in a programming language is defined as a unit of execution by implementing a series of processes as statements and wrapping them in code blocks. Functions in the programming language also take input and send output. In this case, a variable receiving the input is called a parameter, an input is an argument, and an output is a return value. Also, since there may be several functions, you can use function names that are identifiers to distinguish specific functions.

As a function of mathematics, you need to direct the execution of a function by passing parameters, such as arguments, that are needed to execute a predefined set of processes, to the function. This is called function call / invoke. When a function is called, the statements in the code block are executed in a lump and the result is returned.

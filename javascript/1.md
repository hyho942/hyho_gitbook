# Function

## Function is...

A function in a programming language is defined as a unit of execution by implementing a series of processes as statements and wrapping them in code blocks. Functions in the programming language also take input and send output. In this case, a variable receiving the input is called a parameter, an input is an argument, and an output is a return value. Also, since there may be several functions, you can use function names that are identifiers to distinguish specific functions.

As a function of mathematics, you need to direct the execution of a function by passing parameters, such as arguments, that are needed to execute a predefined set of processes, to the function. This is called function call / invoke. When a function is called, the statements in the code block are executed in a lump and the result is returned.

### 1. Function Definition

#### Function Structure

* Function Name
  * For function declarations, function names can not be omitted. A function name is an identifier that makes a call to itself recursively in the function body, or the JavaScript debugger can distinguish the function.
* Parameter
  * Wrap it in parentheses and separate it with a comma. The difference with other languages is that they do not describe the type of the parameter. This may require the type checking of parameters in the function body.
* Function Body

#### 1.1 Function Declarations

```javascript
function NAME(a+b){
    return(a+b);
}
NAME() // Function have to be called
```

#### 1.2 Function Expressions \(Function literal\)

```javascript
let NAME = function(a+b){
    return(a+b);
}
NAME() // Function have to be called
```

#### 1.3 Constructor Function
